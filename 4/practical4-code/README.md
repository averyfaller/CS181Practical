There are two agents you can choose to run:

1) stub_simple.py - This file implements the simple dictionary-binning technique that we achieved our best cumulative scores on.  To run it simply call: 'python stub_simple.py'.  It will run 100 iterations and then print out the max and cumulative scores.

2) stub.py - This file will run SwingyMonkey with Reinforcement Learning.  It can be run by calling: 'python stub.py'.  It can be modified to run other variations of regression in the __init__ method at the top of the Learner class.  It will run 100 iterations and then print out the max and cumulative scores.
